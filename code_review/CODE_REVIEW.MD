2. ask for review
3. feedback loop
4. approval

- not getting useful feedback
- not having enough time to do code reviews
- code reviews taking too long, causing long waiting times

Stakeholders:
- code author
- code reviewer


# Code review for authors

- Make first a code review of your code by yourself

**The best time to fix issues is before you send the code out for review.**

- Aim for small, incremental changes

**The quality and value of code review feedback decrease with the size of the change.**

- provide code review feedback: some reason to now write a description is that the author is to so involved with the code that fall for the expert blind spot thinking that the code is self-explanatory.

**Code reviewing isn't a puzzle. Help reviewers focus on key issues by describing the code change.**

- too many reviewers

**The main problem with adding too many developers as reviewers is that each one of them feels less responsible for giving feedback. Another issue is that adding more people than necessary decreases your teamâ€™s productivity.**

- Clarify review expectations: Notify the reviewer that you expect from them to review

- Add experienced reviewers: Seniors or people that worked with the code that has been changed.

- Add inexperienced reviewers for knowledge transfer
