# Cache Management

*[:arrow_left: Go back](../GENERAL.md)*

Cache is a memory faster than any main or secondary memory in the computer. This cache is located near to the CPU or even in the CPU chip itself. 
Cache is use to accelerate a slower but larger memory type (RAM, Disk) with a faster but smaller memory type (Cache).

## Types of Cache

Cache can be catalog in several levels depending on speed and size.

- **L1 Cache**: Is the faster cache type because is near to the CPU normally in chip itself. This cache has a small size memory.
- **L2 Cache**: This type of cache is slower than **L1** but has larger memory size. This cache is normally located in the motherboard near to the CPU and is connected by a dedicated data bus.
- **L3 Cache**: This cache is the RAM memory itself, it is call cache in this context because RAM backup the data that is Disk so it makes much faster to access this data.
- **L4 Cache**: If RAM is backing up the data of a Disk, in this context the Disk becomes the L4 cache, because if we compare the speed access with external devices or even the Internet Connection, Disk is much faster.
- **Ln cache**: We can add as cache levels as we want depending in devices that are containing the data to be accessed.
