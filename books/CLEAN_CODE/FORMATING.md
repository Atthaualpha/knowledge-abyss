# Formatting

Scrambled code leads to inattention to the details.

Code formatting is important, the code style and readability survives, even thought the code does not.

Formatting is communication.

- Separates concepts by empty lines
- Concepts related should appear vertically dense
- Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible
- instance variables should be declared at the top of the class. Should be declared in a well-known place.
- Function calls should be close were they are called
- conceptual affinity: the stronger affinity, the less vertical distance. (common naming, scheme, and variations of same basic task)
- lines of code should be short (120 characters)
- horizontal alignment should not be separated by multiple whitespace to align the names. This causes lost of relationships between the types and names or values.
- indentation should be always break in new lines even if the block is small like if statements, in this case a break line is sufficient, there is no need o braces
