# Comments

*[:arrow_left: Go back to Clean Code](./CLEAN_CODE_BOOK.md)*

**Do not comment bad code, refactor it!!**

> Comments compensate our failure to express ourself in code

- programmers do not maintain comments.
- Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all
- Truth can only be found in one place: the code
- Do not waste energy writing comments, spend it cleaning the code

## "Good" comments
- Legal comments, for copyright reasons and authorship.
- Warning of consequences.
- TODOs
- Amplification and clarification
- Javadocs

## Bad comments:
- redundant
- Mandated comments
- Journal comments
- Noise comments, do not add anything but redundancy
- Position markers likes //// or ***
- Commenting-out code.
- HTML comments
- Non-local information, when comments describe something that is not near
- Too much information
