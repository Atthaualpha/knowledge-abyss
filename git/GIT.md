# Git

*[:arrow_left: Go back to home](../README.md)*

Git is a distributed version control system, no more than that.

## States of git
git has three main states:
- modified (working directories)
- staged (staging area/index)
- committed (git directory)

### modified
This state means that some changes have been made but has not been committed yet to local database.

### staged
This state means that the changes has been marked to go to the next commit.

### committed
This state means that the changes have been committed to local database.
