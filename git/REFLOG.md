# Reflog

*[:arrow_left: Go back to Git](./GIT.md)*

Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.

This means that as youâ€™re working, Git silently records what your HEAD is every time you change it. `Each time you commit or change branches, the reflog is updated`

## Show reflog history

To see the reflog history you can use the following command.

> `git reflog` 

This will use your HEAD pointer to show updates to HEAD.

Yo can also specify a specific branch just like `git reflog <branch>`

A useful way to use reflog is to see the state in a specific time using the following command:

> `git show HEAD@{1}`

This command uses `show` to display what changes and use the references of the branch or pointer in this case HEAD and is looking for the changes that was moved `1 ago`

So this is useful if is combined with `checkout`, `show` and `reset` commands.
