# Worse is better

*[:arrow_left: Go back](./THOUGHTS.md)*

Worse is better remind us to only focus on what software has to do, and avoid to add extra features that will only overload the system and make less maintainable and even useless features will be provided to the user.

*This alse is a complement to YAGNI principle.*

- Simplicity
The most important characteristic to “worse is better” is simplicity. Both the implementation and the interface of your software must be simple. This means that your program must be easy to use to get the desired result, preferably with a clean, simple user interface.

- Correctness
Next, your software design must work correctly. This means that for every input, it delivers the expected output, without error. (In other words, it does as you expect it to do.)

- Consistency
The third key characteristic of a “worse is better” design is its consistency. That is, your software design should not be overly inconsistent. This means that the design of your software should be somewhat predictable and intuitive.

- Completeness
Finally, “worse is better” isn’t a way of saying ‘bad’ or ‘broken’ software. Your program should provide a whole experience — solve the entire problem it’s supposed to solve.
