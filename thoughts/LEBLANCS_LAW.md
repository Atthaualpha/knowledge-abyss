# LeBlanc's Law

*[:arrow_left: Go back](./THOUGHTS.md)*

> Later == Never

I bet that most of us found ourselves in the middle of a rush trying to finish that feature that we ensure to our customer or boss that would be done for afternoon late and suddenly in the middle of the hurry we found an unexpected behaviour and we have to make a decision in order to reach the deadlines. There is where we rely on ourselves from the future and delegate him the work to finish the debt that we are going to introduce. But the truth is that ourselves from the future will be as busy as we are now. And the cycle start over and over again.

The problem is, we usually don't get around to doing any of those things we plan to do "later".

So the LeBlanc's Law means if you don't finish the current task now, you won't be able to complete it later unless you commit yourselves and take responsibility for what have to be done. 

> So the idea is to thinks this as is ***Now or Never***


*The solution basically comes down to three elements:*

1. Set deadlines
2. Have priorities
3. Review often
