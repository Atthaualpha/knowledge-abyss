## What is event streaming?

It is a pattern to capture events in real-time from different sources in a way of stream, store them in a durably way for later retrieval, manipulating, etc. Allowing to be reactive in real-time when events occur and route them to different destinations as is needed.

## What is Kafka?

Kafka is an event streaming platform. This means that uses the concept of event streaming and provide the platform to implement the use case you need to fulfill.

It combines three key capabilities:
- Publish/Subscriber: Write and read stream of events.
- Storage: Store stream of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
- Processing: Process stream of events when the occur or retrospectively

## Key concepts
- Topic: Stream of data
